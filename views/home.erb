<h1>moviesapi <span class="smallcaps">an API for movies and UK cinema listings
    </span></h1>

<p>moviesapi provides brief movie data, cinema listings and showtimes from UK
   cinemas based upon a postcode. It screenscrapes <a href="http://findanyfilm.com/">
   Find any Film.</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2009/jan/28/digitalmedia-digitalvideo">
   a Guardian article from way back in 2009, they describe that an "API will 
   also be rolled out that will allow developers to build applications around this
   unique and rich data set"</a>. That didn't seem to ever happen.</p>

<p>This was implemented to screenscrape Find any Film and provide a simple data
   source for <a href="https://github.com/yrsIDAT/2013">YRS i-DAT's 2013 project</a>.
   </p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>There are API calls for <strong>listing nearby cinemas by postcode</strong>, and 
<strong>listing cinema times for the next few days</strong>.

<p>It will only return JSON. There is no authentication.</p>

<h3>Nearby Cinemas By Postcode</h3>

<pre><code>GET /cinemas/:postcode</code></pre>

<h4>Response:</h4>

<pre><code>{
   [
       {
           "venue_id": ""
           "name": "Reel, Plymouth, Devon",
           "address": "Reel, Derrys Cross, Plymouth, Devon, PL1 2SW",
           "phone": "01752 663300",
           "url": "http://www.reelcinemas.co.uk",
           "distance": "1.1 miles"
       }
   ]
}
</code></pre>

The postcode should be without spaces (although, with should be fine), like: 
<strong>PL15RH</strong>. The response will be an array of ~10 cinemas.

<h3>Cinema Times By Cinema</h3>

<pre><code>GET /cinemas/:venue_id/showings</code></pre>

<h4>Response</h4>

<pre><code>[
    {
        "title": "Despicable Me 2 (2013) (U)",
        "link":"/Despicable-Me-2~47022",
        "time": [
            "10:30"
        ]
    }
]
</code></pre>

The "venue_id" should be gotten from the "Nearby Cinemas" call above. By default it
returns the listings for today.
